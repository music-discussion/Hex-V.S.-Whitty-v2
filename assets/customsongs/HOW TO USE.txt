TUTORIAL ON HOW TO ADD CUSTOM SONGS: 

VARIABLES:
{songname} will be the name of your stuff. Just imagine it replaced.
Always exclude quotation marks.

Step 1: Open "songs" folder.
Step 2: Create a folder. Make it lowercase using only letters.
Step 3: Inside the folder, put your song in .ogg format. Call it "Inst.ogg".

So it should be like this:

"assets/customsongs/songs/{songname}/Inst.ogg"

If its correct, continue:

Step 4: Open "songsList.txt". In it, type this "{songname}:random#:randomCharacterName".
As the random suggests, say I want to add Headache from garcello. So I do, "headache:69:garcello".

For each new song make another line.

When you have a lot of songs, it may be looking like this: 

ron:7:ron
smiler:7:wtf
quartsrevenge:7:quarter
slices:7:italianer 

CONGRATULATIONS! You now know how to add custom songs! Go crazy!
